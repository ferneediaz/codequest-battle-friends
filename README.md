# Two Sum Learning Assistant

## About

This application is designed to enhance both Data Structure & Algorithm (DSA) skills and communication abilities through an innovative AI-powered Socratic learning approach. Instead of providing direct solutions, the system engages students in a thoughtful dialogue about their problem-solving process.

## Key Features

### 1. Socratic AI Assistant
- Asks targeted questions to guide understanding
- Never provides direct solutions
- Focuses on the immediate step you're stuck on
- Helps students analyze their own code and thinking process

### 2. Interactive Learning Environment
- Real-time communication with AI mentor
- Safe space to explore different approaches
- Encourages self-discovery and deeper understanding

### 3. Collaborative Features
- Party system for group learning
- Real-time collaboration capabilities
- Learn from peer interactions and discussions

## Why This Approach?

Traditional coding platforms often focus solely on whether solutions work or not. Our platform takes a different approach:

1. **Understanding Over Solutions**: Rather than providing answers, we help students understand their thought process.
2. **Communication Skills**: By engaging in dialogue, students improve their ability to articulate technical concepts.
3. **Deep Learning**: The Socratic method leads to deeper understanding and better retention of concepts.

## Getting Started

1. Set up your Groq API key in the settings
2. Start discussing your approach to the Two Sum problem
3. Engage with the AI's questions to deepen your understanding
4. Form or join a party to learn collaboratively

## Technologies Used

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- Groq API for AI interactions
